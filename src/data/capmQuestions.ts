    scenario:
      "Your company is developing a new customer-facing mobile app. The sponsor wants to release the full application at once, but the competitive market is evolving quickly.",
    question:
      "What should you do first to ensure the project delivers value as soon as possible?",
    options: [
      "Prioritise the backlog based on business value and work with stakeholders to plan incremental releases",
      "Ask the team to focus only on developing the features that are easiest to implement first",
      "Delay the discussion until the full design is complete",
      "Insist that the sponsor chooses which features to release first",
    ],
    correctAnswer:
      "Prioritise the backlog based on business value and work with stakeholders to plan incremental releases",
    explanation:
      "Incremental delivery requires identifying and prioritising valuable features so early releases deliver maximum value. Other options delay value or contradict Agile practices."
