    question:
      "A project is initiated to implement a new customer onboarding system in a bank. Which characteristic best distinguishes this initiative from routine operational work?",
    options: [
      "It involves multiple departments",
      "It is temporary and creates a unique outcome",
      "It requires senior management approval",
      "It uses specialised software",
    ],
    correctAnswer:
      "It is temporary and creates a unique outcome",
    explanation:
      "According to PMI, a project is a temporary endeavour undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. This definition clearly distinguishes projects from ongoing operations. Operations may also involve multiple departments. Approval is required for many operational initiatives. Tools and technology do not define a project.",

  {
    scenario: "",
    question:
      "Which of the following best describes the relationship between a programme and a portfolio?",
    options: [
      "A programme is a subset of a portfolio",
      "A portfolio is a subset of a programme",
      "Both manage unrelated projects",
      "Programmes only exist in agile environments",
    ],
    correctAnswer:
      "A programme is a subset of a portfolio",
    explanation:
      "A portfolio groups projects and programmes to achieve strategic objectives. A programme manages related projects, making it a subset of a portfolio. Programmes manage related, not unrelated, projects. Programmes are methodology-agnostic.",

  {
    scenario: "",
    question:
      "Who is primarily responsible for ensuring that the project delivers business value?",
    options: [
      "Project Manager",
      "Project Sponsor",
      "Project Team",
      "PMO",
    ],
    correctAnswer:
      "Project Sponsor",
    explanation:
      "The project sponsor owns the business case and is accountable for benefits realisation and value delivery. The project manager focuses on delivery within constraints. The team delivers outputs, not outcomes. The PMO provides standards and governance.",

  {
    scenario: "",
    question:
      "A stakeholder has high influence but low interest in day-to-day project work. What is the most appropriate engagement strategy?",
    options: [
      "Monitor",
      "Keep informed",
      "Keep satisfied",
      "Manage closely",
    ],
    correctAnswer:
      "Keep satisfied",
    explanation:
      "Stakeholders with high power and low interest should be kept satisfied to maintain support without excessive communication. Monitoring is for low power, low interest. Keeping informed is for low power, high interest. Managing closely is for high power, high interest.",

  {
    scenario: "",
    question:
      "Which project life cycle provides the greatest ability to accommodate change throughout the project?",
    options: [
      "Predictive",
      "Iterative",
      "Incremental",
      "Agile",
    ],
    correctAnswer:
      "Agile",
    explanation:
      "Agile life cycles are designed to embrace change, even late in development, through frequent feedback and adaptation. Predictive life cycles resist late changes. Iterative allows refinement but within planned boundaries. Incremental delivers in parts but is not fully adaptive.",

      "When is the project charter formally approved?",
    options: [
      "During Planning",
      "During Initiating",
      "During Executing",
      "During Closing",
    ],
    correctAnswer:
      "During Initiating",
    explanation:
      "The project charter is approved in the Initiating phase to formally authorise the project and the project manager. Planning cannot begin without an approved charter. Execution requires formal authorisation. Closing occurs after deliverables are completed.",
  },

  {
    scenario: "",
    question:
      "Which document formally authorises the project manager to apply organisational resources to project activities?",
    options: [
      "Business case",
      "Project management plan",
      "Project charter",
      "Benefits management plan",
    ],
    correctAnswer:
      "Project charter",
    explanation:
      "The project charter formally authorises both the project and the project manager. The business case justifies the project but does not authorise execution. The project management plan is developed after authorisation. The benefits management plan describes benefits realisation, not authority.",
  },

  {
    scenario: "",
    question:
      "What is the primary purpose of stakeholder identification?",
    options: [
      "To approve project scope",
      "To understand expectations and influence",
      "To assign tasks",
      "To estimate costs",
    ],
    correctAnswer:
      "To understand expectations and influence",
    explanation:
      "Identifying stakeholders allows the project team to understand expectations, interests, and influence, enabling effective engagement. Scope approval is sponsor responsibility. Task assignment is part of execution. Cost estimation is a planning activity.",

      "Which organisational structure gives the project manager the least authority?",
    options: [
      "Functional",
      "Weak matrix",
      "Balanced matrix",
      "Strong matrix",
    ],
    correctAnswer:
      "Functional",
    explanation:
      "In a functional organisation, authority resides with functional managers, not the project manager. Weak matrix gives slightly more authority than functional. Balanced matrix shares authority. Strong matrix gives high authority to the project manager.",

      "Track project costs",
      "Define how and when benefits will be realised",
      "Control scope changes",
      "Assign responsibilities to the team",
    ],
    correctAnswer:
      "Define how and when benefits will be realised",
    explanation:
      "The benefits management plan defines how project outcomes translate into measurable business benefits. Costs are tracked in the cost management plan. Scope control uses change management processes. Responsibilities are defined in a RACI or HR plan.",

    ],
    correctAnswer:
      "Project Sponsor",
    explanation:
      "The project sponsor has authority to continue, suspend, or terminate the project based on business considerations. The project manager cannot unilaterally cancel a project. The team executes work. The PMO advises but does not decide.",

      "Which factor has the greatest influence on a project’s ability to succeed?",
    options: [
      "Tools and techniques",
      "Organisational culture",
      "Project schedule",
      "Risk register",
    ],
    correctAnswer:
      "Organisational culture",
    explanation:
      "Organisational culture and environment strongly influence behaviours, decision-making, and support for projects. Tools and schedules are important but secondary. The risk register is a supporting artifact.",
  },

  // 13
  {
    scenario: "",
    question:
      "What is the primary purpose of project governance?",
    options: [
      "To manage the project schedule",
      "To ensure alignment with organisational strategy",
      "To assign tasks to the team",
      "To control day-to-day activities",
    ],
    correctAnswer:
      "To ensure alignment with organisational strategy",
    explanation:
      "Project governance provides oversight, decision-making frameworks, and alignment with organisational strategy to ensure value delivery. It does not manage day-to-day work.",

      "Directive PMO",
      "Functional PMO",
    ],
    correctAnswer:
      "Directive PMO",
    explanation:
      "A Directive PMO directly manages projects and assigns project managers, exercising the highest level of control. Supportive and controlling PMOs provide less authority.",

  {
    scenario: "",
    question:
      "Which statement best describes value delivery in project management?",
    options: [
      "Delivering outputs on time and on budget",

      "Creating outcomes that realise intended benefits",
      "Producing detailed documentation",
    ],
    correctAnswer:
      "Creating outcomes that realise intended benefits",
    explanation:
      "Value is realised when intended benefits and outcomes are achieved. Outputs, activities, and documentation alone do not guarantee value.",

    correctAnswer:
      "Understand interactions between components",

    ],
    correctAnswer:
      "Enable value delivery and adaptability",
    explanation:
      "Modern PM guidance positions the project manager as a value enabler, not just a controller. Excessive control reduces adaptability. Scope alone does not guarantee value. Leadership replaces command-and-control.",

    ],
    correctAnswer:
      "Improved acceptance and reduced resistance",
